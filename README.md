## Overview
The goal of this project is to:
1. Generate synthetic data with a linear relationship and added noise.
2. Train a linear regression model using `scikit-learn`.
3. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
4. Visualize the results.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
